Here are the highlights on loan data analysis:

 Approval rates are holding steady at 68.7%, with semi-urban markets showing the strongest performance.
 Credit history continues to be the most influential approval factor, lifting the odds by 21.6%.
 Customer segments behave in distinct—and strategically valuable—ways:

Urban, college-educated applicants see approval rates reaching 78%.
Families with two dependents consistently show the highest reliability.
Self-employed applicants fall behind, pointing to an opportunity to strengthen underwriting for non-traditional income profiles.

On the property side, the patterns are just as telling:
• Semi-urban customers strike the best balance between approval and loan size.
• Urban borrowers convert well but tend to request smaller amounts.
• Rural markets lag, especially for applicants without credit history.

When the growth levers are this clear, focus becomes easier:
– Tighten underwriting criteria for thin-file applicants
– Direct marketing toward segments with both high conversion and strong value
– Shape acquisition strategies around reliability, not just reach
